# CliRr

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonMTS/CliRr/v2/example.gif)

A command-line, low-overhead, unobtrusive way to loop youtube videos.

* VLC must be installed and be accessible from path. (and you might have to turn off `remember volume`)
* Has been tested on Windows 10 & Debian 9.11

  It seems that linux CLI VLC is a quite a bit more buggy, and the volume flag also appears to be broken.

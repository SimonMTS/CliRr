A command-line youtube video looper.

I like to listen to single songs on repeat while working. Originally I did this with "youtuberepeat.com", but that's quite an annoying website. So this is a low-overhead, unobtrusive alternative.

* VLC must be installed and be accessible from path.
* This has only been tested on windows.

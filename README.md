# CliRr

A command-line youtube video looper.

This is a low-overhead, unobtrusive way to loop youtube videos.

* VLC must be installed and be accessible from path. (and you might have to turn off `remember volume`)
* Has been tested on Windows 10 & Debian 9.11

  It seems that CLI VLC is a quite a bit more buggy on linux, and volume also appears to be broken on linux.
